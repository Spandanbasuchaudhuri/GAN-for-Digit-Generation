# GAN for Digit Generation

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic digit images similar to those found in the MNIST dataset. The goal is to train the GAN so that the generator network can create realistic digit images, while the discriminator network learns to distinguish between real and fake images.

## Project Structure

### Files:
- **GAN for Digit Generation.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook containing the code for implementing and training the GAN model.

### Dependencies:
The project uses the following Python libraries:
- `torch` (PyTorch): For building and training the GAN.
- `torchvision`: For loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
- `matplotlib`: For visualizing real and generated digit images.
- `numpy`: For handling data arrays.

To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
```

## How It Works

### 1. Data Loading:
The project uses the MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The dataset is loaded and preprocessed using `torchvision`.

### 2. GAN Model Architecture:
The GAN consists of two neural networks:
- **Generator**: Takes in random noise (latent space vectors) and generates 28x28 images.
- **Discriminator**: Classifies input images as real (from the dataset) or fake (generated by the generator).

### 3. Training:
- The model is trained for 100 epochs (or user-defined epochs).
- During each epoch, the discriminator and generator are trained in alternation:
  - The discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and fake images.
  - The generator is trained to produce images that can fool the discriminator.

### 4. Visualizing Results:
The notebook includes code for displaying real and generated images side by side after training. This helps to assess the quality of the generated digits.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. **Set up your environment**: Make sure you have the dependencies installed.
2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: You can run the notebook using the Jupyter environment:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "GAN for Digit Generation.ipynb"
   ```
3. **Train the GAN**: Run the cells to load the data, define the model, and begin training. 
4. **View the Results**: After training, the notebook displays both real and generated images for comparison.

## Key Functions and Code Blocks

- **Generator and Discriminator Networks**: Custom PyTorch models designed for the task.
- **Training Loop**: Code to train the GAN, update both generator and discriminator.
- **Visualization**: The `visualize_comparison` function compares real and generated images during training.

## Hyperparameters

- `batch_size`: 32
- `learning_rate`: 0.0002
- `epochs`: 100
- `noise_dim`: 100 (dimension of the noise input to the generator)

You can modify these hyperparameters in the notebook to experiment with the model's performance.

## Results

After training, the GAN should generate realistic-looking digit images. The quality of the generated images improves as the training progresses.

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with different network architectures.
- Use other datasets for generating non-digit images.
- Implement advanced GAN techniques, such as conditional GANs (CGANs) or Wasserstein GANs (WGANs).
